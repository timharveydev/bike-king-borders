# bike-king-borders-website
A website for a fictional bike shop in the Scottish borders, created as part of my HNC Web Development college course.

The process for creating this website involved creating a complete requirement specification and a design specification from the ground up before beginning work on the coding itself.

The website was coded with raw HTML5 and CSS3, with no frameworks. Media queries were used to make it responsive across three devices (PC/laptop, tablet, mobile). The only aspect of responsiveness which I haven't gotten around to finishing is responsiveness for mobile phones in landscape format (portrait is responsive).

Aside from the HTML/CSS, I added a very small amount of Javascript to create the burger menu for mobile devices. I also included a Google Maps API in the Contact page, though I don't have a paid Google account so the Maps API is more of a placeholder than a functional item.
